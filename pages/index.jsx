       Lorem Ipsum is just like sexist behaviors in creative departments. You don't pay attention, you just play around. But also, why take a dead language poem or women seriously? After all, they are just a small number in agencies. That, by the way, is inversely proportional to all the sexist and sexual jokes they hear so frequently.
